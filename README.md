# [Dan Olvera](https://daocodes.com/) Portfolio
This site showcases what I am currently up to, current projects, and other things about myself.

## Overview
I am an Experienced Software Engineer currently at IntelliTect, where I focus on AI enablement and building high-performance cloud solutions. I mainly work in .NET, Azure, and angular but love to learn new technologies and am constantly looking at new frameworks or stacks.

## Featured Projects

- BreakPoint.AI: A custom ML stack designed to analyze tennis swings and provide coaching feedback.
- AI-Driven Indexing: A production-ready solution that automated textbook indexing, saving 4 weeks of manual labor.
- High-Scale PDF Rendering: An AWS-powered solution capable of processing 100,000 bills in under 12 minutes.

## Community Involvement
I am passionate about fostering the local tech ecosystem and currently organize the [Spokane .NET User Group](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRjft3wXvK_uIOFkhjCmW0Zd4Hp3vIvn9) to promote inclusive learning among developers.
